# Space X Docs

This project utilizes the Space-X API to display information and news about Space-X. The application was built using React and Redux. Project supports routing and is deployed using Vercel.

The React application utilizes the SpaceX API version 3 **and** version 4. I am currently in the process of migrating all v.3 endpoints to v.4, but not all of the original content is still supported, so some content/routes will change.
